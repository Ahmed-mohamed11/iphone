The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are <code>smartphones</code> designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They make up the 11th
generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on <code>September 22</code>, 2017, succeeding the <code>iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[8]</code>
and preceding the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were discontinued by Apple on April 15, 2020 with the release
of <code>the second-generation iPhone SE</code>.

Except for the addition of a glass back, the designs of the <code>iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar</code> to that of their
predecessors. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[9] addition of
inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their
internal hardware with the <code>iPhone X</code>.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, <code>having sold 86.3 million units</code> worldwide, making them one
of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[10][11] The entry-level iPhone SE second and third generations share the
iPhone 8's exterior dimensions.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final models of the flagship iPhone model to feature the Home Button and <code>Touch ID</code>.

                <code>What is the best MacBook?</code>
                The best MacBook for each person will differ, but there's a great
                option for virtually anyone in Apple'slaptop lineup
                in 2022. The introduction of its ARM-based M1 chip in 2020 kicked off a new
                era for Apple laptops. Apple's in-house SoC
                has brought massive performance and battery life improvements to the entire
                MacBook range.
                Now joined by the M1 Pro, M1 Max and M2, Apple has you covered regardless of
                your needs. The M2 MacBook AIr and Pro
                aren't likely to see any deals yet, but if you are in the market for
                any of the rest of <code>Apple's laptops</code> keep an eye on
                the best <code>Amazon Prime</code> Day MacBook deals for likely the lowest prices
                we'll see until Black Friday this fall.
                While you still aren't going to want to pick an Apple laptop for your
                gaming laptop, they are an outstanding choice for
                virtually any other use case, including as college laptops or business laptops.
                Transforming its once underpowered laptop to one of the fastest thin
                -and-lights on the market, the MacBook
                Air with M1
                is the best Mac for most people. It turbocharges that familiar design
                with record-setting performance and all-day
                battery life. Along with speed and endurance boosts, the M1 chip brings
                iOS and iPadOS apps to Mac for the first time
                ever. While the M1 model is sticking around at its $999 price point,
                the redesigned MacBook Air M2 gives slightly more
                performance-hungry portable MacBook fans another option.TRENDING Best laptops

                RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...
                If you need sustained high-level performance, you might want to opt for the MacBook Pro M2 13-inch with two
                Thunderbolt
                4 ports. While the MacBook Air is fanless, the MacBook Pro has a traditional cooling system to run demanding
                programs
                for hours without worrying about overheating. Most people will be fine with the Air, but power users should
                consider
                stepping up to the Pro.The MacBook Air M1 remains the best MacBook for most people. What about the MacBook
                Air M2? It's a fantastic laptop that
                we'll cover next on this list, but the reality is that for the majority of users the upgrades aren't
                necessary and the
                M1 model maintains that sub-$1,000 starting price and is often discounted to $900 or less.
